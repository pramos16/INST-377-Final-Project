# INST-377-Final-Project

I will be using the http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name= api to create a website that displays all the universities that display a certain text. 
The website will help people search for Universities by State, City, or any other text they would like. 
The link to github pages is https://pramos16.github.io/INST-377-Final-Project/
